To make the kit, one will have to print (with a 3d printer):
- MDL-motor_support wich is the part where we will fix the motor, this part afer will be put on an aquarium border. Need to precise the screw to put on (x4)
- MDL-rod_fixation wich is a piece to link a metal rod (MDL-rod) with the motor. There is two holes to put 2 screw the upper one (motor size) need to stick out so it will hit the motor_support when initialising (searching it's 0). The second one use to fix the rod. (diameter of the screw)
MDL-transducer depend on your transducer better to make your own. When we will have (ENS) typical transducer we will make an appropritate support.

MDL-phantom_support depend on the size of you aquarium (this one is for xxx mm large).
MDL-stick must be place in MDL-phantom
MDL-plate_support was made to put a thin plate for tests. It plug with MDL-stick
The three last MDL are not necessary

For 3dprinting use MDL-x.stl files. If you want to make modifications one can use freecad (open the .igs file) modify and then export in .stl file (mesh formats files).
