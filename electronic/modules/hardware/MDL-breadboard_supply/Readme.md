## About the module

### Pros

* Based on a breadboard alim

### Cons

* Takes a lot of space 

## Constraint and limits

### Testing different alims

Quality of the power supply is key: it can introduce noise in the final

## Discussions

### TODO

* _BONUS!_ benchmark power supplies 

### DONE

* Manage to feed it 12V
* Bring power to it through the 12V `ITF-F_12V` track 
* Test if 12V OK
* Find supplier
