* version: V0.3
* date: 15/11/2016
* technology: STM32F205
* language: n/a
* cost:35$

* author: Kelu124

## IOs

### Inputs

* `ITF-A_gnd`
* `ITF-B_5v`
* `ITF-E_signal_envelope`
* `ITF-I_pulse_on`
* `ITF-J_pulse_off`

### Outputs

* `ITF-mED-TFT-Screen`
* `ITF-mED-OLED-Screen`
* `ITF-mEC-WiFi-UDP-Stream`

## Key Components

* `Feather WICED` : see notes

## Information

### What is it supposed to do?

The aim of this echOmod is to receive the signal and process it.

### How does it work: block diagram

* `ITF-E_signal_envelope`->`Feather WICED`->`WiFi`
* `Feather WICED`->`ITF-mED-TFT-Screen`
* `Feather WICED`->`WiFi`->`ITF-mEC-WiFi-UDP-Stream`



## About the module

### Pros

* Building on an existing STM32, compatible with the Arduino IDE

### Cons

* ADC is tough to master

## Constraint and limits

* A series of work has been done on ![EMW3165](notes_EMW3165.md),  ![ESP8266](notes_ESP8266.md), ![Raspberry Pi Zero](notes_RPi0.md), ![feather WICED](notes_feather_WICED.md). The EMW3165 gave birth to __[Kina](/retired/kina/)__ for slow speed wireless UDP streaming.
* A recap of microcontrolers has been added [here](notes_uC.md)



## Some images

They can be [found here](data/examples/). 

They have been acquired with `nc -lu 5005` to listen to data coming from UDP port 5005, then translated in images using the [CreateCSV.py](data/examples/CreateCSV.py) script, which creates the raw data files, ready to be processed, respecting the format, and scan converted using the [CreateSC.py](data/examples/CreateSC.py) script for a nearest neighbour scan conversion.

## Boosting the ADC work

### Getting to work with two onboard ADCs. Getting a relatively nice signal.

#### September:

In a nutshell: getting roughly 12bits, 2Msps+ ADC acquisition and Wifi-streaming, on a powerbank. [Read more here](feather_tests/2016-09-10-Feather_ADC.md) for the details on the STM32 work. [Arduino code here, with details for setup](feather_tests/2ADC2UDP.ino).

Video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyfDMsgAquI).

#### December:

Later on, in december, I got it work with a [breadboard phantom](data/20161217/20161217-TestingArduinoAndPhantom.md)

## Discussions

### TODO

* Replace the work done by [OneEye](/electronic/modules/hardware/MDL-pulser_control/) by [Croaker]().
* Get better total ADC speed with an iterleaved move

### DONE

* Choose the platform (BBB, RPi0, STM32, ... ?) : that'll be a `Feather WICED`
* Getting some images
* Getting images onto a screen
